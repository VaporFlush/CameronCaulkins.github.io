            <h3>Warning: Due to team issues, this project finished with issues.</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Audio: Audio starts super loud. you can change this in the settings menu.</li>
                <li>Player Camera Sensitivity: This is also super high. The settings menu doesn't change the sensitvity.</li>
                <li>Room Layout: The layout of the dungeon is random without checks for how they are placed. This can cause layouts with rooms leading to nothing, or the wall of another room. This propblem also makes it so some layouts don't have a way to the boss room making it impossible to finish the game.</li>
            </ul>
