                <h2>Block Topia</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in charge of a a month-long project to develop a Tetris clone and a custom rendering engine, collaborating with a designer and another programmer. I was the team lead and lead programmer overseeing the project to completion. I coordinated efforts to ensure seamless devopment with our project. Using our custom rendering engine, we recreated a visually simple and dynamically responsive Tetris experience. As lead programmer, I fucused on the implementation of game mechanics, and fine-tuning every aspect to deliver an authentic Tetris gameplay experience. Together with our dedicated team, we overcame challenges with agility and determination, delivering a Tetris clone that not only showcased our technical prowess but also reflected our collective creativity and passion for game development.</p>

                <h2>Conway's Game of Life</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a month-long endeavor, I embarked on recreating Conway's Game of Life using WXWidgets, showcasing my prowess in game development and GUI design. Using WXWidgets, I made a graphical interface, allowing users to engage with the simulation. Central to the project was the implementation of Conway's rules, dynamically updating cell states based on neighboring conditions, a testament to my algorithmic proficiency. The project boasts features such as customizable grid sizes, adjustable simulation speeds, and pattern saving/loading, enhancing its functionality and user appeal. With meticulous attention to detail, rigorous debugging, and effective time management, I successfully realized this project, underscoring my capabilities as a game developer and GUI designer.</p>
